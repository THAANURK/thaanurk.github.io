                                             Data scrapping

### Data scrapping

```
 I used this to find the top selling products to avoid the problem of importing unwanted products. 
 Also i used the ratings and reviews to find the problems with the products via sentiment analysis. 
 To use this change the class name of the product by inspecting the needed element `class_name`.
