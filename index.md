## Welcome to my portfolio

You can see things that are not there in my resume, these items are developed in my own interest and ideas.

I work around with IOS App development, data scrapping, Game designing and backend development.

### IOS

```
BcardAr

```

For more details see [BCARD-AR](https://github.com/THAANURK/BCardAr).

### 

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/THAANURK/thaanurk.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
