## Welcome to my portfolio

You can see things that are not there in my resume, these items are developed in my own interest and ideas.

I work around with IOS App development, data scrapping, Game designing and backend development.

### IOS

```
BcardAr
This is a Business card viewer application with Augmented reality feature. It uses Apple's native CORE AR and CORE VISION framework. 

Supported version : IOS 10 + 
Language used : Swift

```

For more details see [BCARD-AR](https://github.com/THAANURK/BCardAr).

### Data scrapping

Data scrapping for ECommerce projects. I used this to find the top selling products to avoid the problem of importing unwanted products. Also i used the ratings and reviews to find the problems with the products via sentiment analysis.  [ECommerce Data scrapping](https://github.com/THAANURK/FlipkartScrapper). To use this change the class name of the product by inspecting the needed element `class_name`.
